## AB = Above/Below ##

This directory contains test images for stereoscopic format
above/below, where the image pair is contained in a single JPEG file
and the left image is on top, and the right image is on the bottom.
This format is less common than the `ABQ` (Above/Below sQuashed) which
is commonly used for 3D TVs with passive polarized screens.
