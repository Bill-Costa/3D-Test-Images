## AB : Above/Below ##

This directory contains test images for the stereoscopic format
above/below, where the image pair is contained in a single JPEG file
and the left image is on top, and the right image is on the bottom.
This format is used in applications like transmitting stereoscopic
images over HDMI, as from a Blu-ray player.  It could be considered as
the native format for
[active shutter 3D TVs and monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_television#Displaying_technologies).

For s3D stills, the primary advantage of this format is that it works
well with images that have a strong landscape aspect ratio, such as
16:9 HD images.  Stacking the two images results in a JPG file that is
more easily viewed with non-stereoscopic software.  Combining two L/R
landscape images into a side-by-side JPG results in a very wide and
skinny thumbnail, making it harder to see details.

*Contrast with* the `ABQ` (Above/Below sQuashed) format typically used
for 3D TVs and monitors
[with passive polarized screens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_television#Displaying_technologies).
