## AB : Above/Below ##

This directory contains test images for the stereoscopic format
above/below, where the image pair is contained in a single JPEG file
and the left image is on top, and the right image is on the bottom.
This format is used in applications like Blu-ray 3D disks, and is the
native format for 
[active shutter 3D TVs and monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_television#Displaying_technologies).

(Contrast with the `ABQ` (Above/Below sQuashed) format typically used
for 3D TVs and monitors
[with passive polarized screens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_television#Displaying_technologies).)
