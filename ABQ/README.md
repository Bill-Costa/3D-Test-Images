## ABQ : Above/Below sQuashed ##

This directory contains test images for the stereoscopic format half
height above/below, where the image pair is contained in a single JPEG
file and the left image is on top, and the right image is on the
bottom. Both images are half height, meaning that alternate horizontal
scan lines have been thrown away, resulting in a 'squashed' image.

This format is designed specifically for row-interlaced stereoscopic
3D displays
[with passive polarized screens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_television#Displaying_technologies).

For s3D stills, the primary advantage of this format is that it can be
used to display stereoscopic images on a passive 3D TV or computer
monitor, using conventional image viewing software.  It also results
in a JPG image that has the same aspect ratio as the original image,
which yields easier to view thumbnail images, and saves a bit of disc
space.  But the primary disadvantage is that this is a very lossy
format, which prevents the re-conversion of the image into a different
s3D format, or even extracting a 'normal' 2D image.

*Contrast with* the `AB` (Above/Below) format which preserves the full
vertical resolution, and is compatible with
[active shutter 3D TVs and monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_television#Displaying_technologies).
