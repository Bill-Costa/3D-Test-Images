# 3D Test Images #

The goal of this project is to provide a set of stereoscopic 3D (s3D)
images to aid in the testing and evaluation of stereographic digital
displays.  See this project's
[wiki](https://github.com/Bill-Costa/3D-Test-Images/wiki) for more
background information and details.

## Features ##

Provided here are a set of JPEG test images in a variety of sizes and
formats most commonly used for s3D displays.  These include:

- A test to evaluate crosstalk (ghosting) issues.

- A test illustrating the concept of the
 [stereo window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereo_window#Stereo_window).

- Tests for discovering the optimum image size for a given
  device and software.

- Sample s3D images.

- `extinction-red-cyan-*` : For multiplexed displays, such as 3D TVs
  and autostereoscopic (glasses free) displays, this test reveals the
  level of crosstalk (ghosting) between the left and right images.  In
  particular, this test is valuable in assessing the uniformity and
  alignment of the
  [FPR polarizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film-type_patterned_retarder)
  commonly used on passive 3D TVs.

  **USAGE:** For 3D TVs, this test requires wearing the appropriate 3D
  glasses for your set.  while wearing the required 3D glasses, view
  the image with only one eye at a time.  You should see a uniform
  color for each eye.

- `depth-black-white-*` : This test image 

## Getting Started ##

The images provided are designed to be downloaded to your s3D viewing
device and viewed as you would any stereoscopic image on that device.
No other software is required.  The images have been crafted to allow
you to evaluate aspects of your viewing device just by observation.
In particular, the resolution test will allow you to evaluate how well
your device can render image resolutions other than the native display
size.  Note that the image quality can also be dependant upon the
particular application that is displaying the image or the input
source.

You do not need to download all of the images, only those contained
within the directory that matches the stereographic format appropriate
for your device.  Here are the currently supplied formats.  If your
device requires a format not listed here, please
[file an issue](https://github.com/Bill-Costa/3D-Test-Images/issues).

| Directory | Description    | Notes                                        |
|----:|:---------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| MPO | Multi-Picture Object | container file; separate left & right images  |
| JPS | Stereoscopic JPEG    | right/left as a single side-by-side images    |
| LR  | Left/Right           | left/right side-by-side images                |
| LRB | Left/Right w/ Border | bars added to maintain 16:9 aspect ratio      |
| LRQ | Left/Right sQuashed  | half width left/right images                  |
| AB  | Above/Below          | above-below images; left on top               |
| ABQ | Above/Below sQuashed | half height above/below images                |

Please see the
[wiki](https://github.com/Bill-Costa/3D-Test-Images/wiki) for more
information and illustrations of these formats.
