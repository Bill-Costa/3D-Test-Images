## LR : Left/Right ##

This directory contains test images for the stereoscopic format
left/right, where the image pair is contained in a single JPEG file in
a side-by-side format, with the left image on the left.  (This is
sometimes called 'wall-eye' format, in contrast to 'cross-eye' format
where the left image is on the right.)

This format is commonly used for storing s3D images because of its
natural intuitive arrangement.  It is often the default format used by
stereoscopic software for loading and saving stereogrphic images.

*Contrast with* the 'JPS' (Stereo JPEG), `LRP` (Left/Right Pillarbox),
 and 'LRQ' (Left/Right sQuashed) formats.
